Property Class - Get Set
Constructor - Memory - Allocate - new - automatically - implicit invocation
Methods - explicit invocation
obj.methodName();
Same name as that of our class
Is similar to method declaration
access SPecifier - Name followed by Paranthesis then by {}
public Cons1()
{}
Constructor does not have return Type
Initialising the class members

Constructor OverLoading or Parameterised Constructor- POlymorphism
Constructor & Inheritence
BAse class members to be initialised through derived class and this is achieved using the keyword base
Destructor - reallocate the memory
implicit invocation
programatically - destructor name will have same class name
One destructor
Aggregator - Class - few Members / Another class - few other members -

Relationship
Instantiation  - creating object
Inheritence - 
Aggregation

Abstract Class - Base
abstract method - which only declaration - definition
Inheriting class will define the method
Mandatory for the inheriting class to implement the abstract method.


Interface
-declaration - class implements the interface will define the methods
mandatory for the class to implement the interface methods
Inheritance - multiple -more than one class time - NO
Multi- Level 


Sealed Class 
Built-in Functions
File IO
